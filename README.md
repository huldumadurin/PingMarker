# PingMarker
Starts Digital Ocean droplets in various regions and pings a list of servers for comparison.

# Hypothesis


# Experiment
In order to analyze the ping behavior of three servers:

* 128.199.144.199
* 167.99.51.33
* 46.101.253.149

And knowing that ping time is very location-dependent, it would be nice 
to have results from a few different places in the world. This will let 
me control for slow connectivity and instability from my local ISP.
