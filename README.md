# PingMarker
Starts Digital Ocean droplets in various regions and pings a list of servers for comparison.

## Hypothesis **_TODO:_ Formulate proper hypothesis**
Network error, Network quality, changing response time over short term 
(Variable load?), changing response time over day/week (Possibly 
correlated to website userbase work hours, but very hard to prove?)  

## Experiment **_TODO:_ Explain Vagrantfile, runscript.sh, 
spreadsheet? ** 
In order to analyze the ping behavior of three servers:

* 128.199.144.199
* 167.99.51.33
* 46.101.253.149

And knowing that ping time is very location-dependent, it would be nice 
to have results from a few different places in the world. This will let 
me control for slow connectivity and instability from my local ISP.

## Results **_TODO_ Run experiment**


## Discussion


## Conclusion
